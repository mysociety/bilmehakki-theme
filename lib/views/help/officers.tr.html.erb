  <dt id="vexatious">Aren't you making lots of vexatious requests? <a href="#vexatious">#</a></dt>
  <dd><p><%= site_name %> is not making any requests. We are sending requests on
    behalf of our users, who are real people making the requests. </p>
    <p>Look at it like this - if lots of different people made requests from
    different Hotmail email addresses, then you would not think that Microsoft were
    making vexatious requests. It is exactly the same if lots of requests are made
    via <%= site_name %>. Moreover, since all requests are public it is much easier
    for you to see if one of our users is making vexatious requests. </p>
    <p>If that isn't enough for you, the
    <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/1142/response/2894/attach/5/20080806100741260.pdf">letter from the ICO to Rother District Council</a> gives some guidance on the matter.</p>
  </dd>

  <!-- TODO -->
  <dt id="spam_problems">I can see a request on <%= site_name %>, but we never got it by email!<a href="#spam_problems">#</a> </dt>
  <dd><p>If a request appears on the site, then we have attempted to send it to
    the authority by email. Any delivery failure messages will automatically
    appear on the site. You can check the address we're using with the "View FOI
    email address" link which appears on the page for the authority. <a
    href="/help/contact">Contact us</a> if there is a better address we can
    use.</p>
    <p>Requests are sometimes not delivered because they are quietly removed by
    "spam filters" in the IT department of the authority. Authorities can make
    sure this doesn't happen by asking their IT departments to "whitelist"
    any email from <strong>@<%= AlaveteliConfiguration::incoming_email_domain %></strong>.
    If you <a href="/help/contact">ask us</a> we will resend any request,
    and/or give technical details of delivery so an IT department can chase
    up what happened to the message.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, you can respond to any request from your web browser, without
    needing any email, using the "respond to request" link at the bottom of
    each request page.

  <!-- TODO -->
  <dt id="days">How do you calculate the deadline shown on request pages?<a href="#days">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The Freedom of Information Act says:</p>

    <blockquote><p>A public authority must comply with section 1(1) <strong>promptly</strong> and
    in any event not later than the twentieth working day following the date of
    receipt.</p></blockquote>

    <p>The nerdy detail of exactly how weekends are counted, and what happens if
    the request arrives out of office hours, is just that - detail. What matters
    here is that the law says authorities must respond <strong>promptly</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you've got a good reason why the request is going to take a while to
    process, requesters find it really helpful if you can send a quick email with a
    sentence or two saying what is happening. </p>

    <p>FOI officers often have to do a lot of <strong>hard work</strong> to answer
    requests, and this is hidden from the public. We think it would help everyone
    to have more of that complexity visible.</p>
  </dd>

  <!-- TODO -->
  <dt id="days2">But really, how do you calculate the deadline?<a href="#days2">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Please read the answer to the previous question first. Legally, authorities
    must respond <strong>promptly</strong> to FOI requests. If they fail to do that,
    it is best if they show the hard work they are doing by explaining what is
    taking the extra time to do.
    </p>

    <p>That said, <%= site_name %> does show the maximum legal deadline
    for response on each request. Here's how we calculate it.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>If the day we deliver the request by email is a working day, we count that
    as "day zero", even if it was delivered late in the evening. Days end at
    midnight.  We then count the next working day as "day one", and so on up to
    <strong>20 working days</strong>.</li>

    <li>If the day the request email was delivered was a non-working day, we count
    the next working day as "day one". Delivery is delivery, even if it happened on
    the weekend. Some authorities <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/policy_regarding_body_scans#incoming-1100">disagree with this</a>, our lawyer disagrees with them. </li>

    <li>Requesters are encouraged to mark when they have <strong>clarified</strong>
    their request so the clock resets, but sometimes they get this wrong. If you
    see a problem with a particular request, let us know and we'll fix it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The date thus calculated is shown on requests with the text "By law,
    Liverpool City Council should normally have responded by...". There is only
    one case which is not normal, see the next question about
    <a href="#public_interest_test">public interest test time extensions</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Schools are also a special case, which <%= site_name %> displays differently.
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Since June 2009, <strong>schools</strong> have "20 working days
    disregarding any working day which is not a school day, or 60 working days,
    whichever is first" (<a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2009/draft/ukdsi_9780111477632_en_1">FOI (Time for Compliance with Request) Regulations 2009</a>). <%= site_name %> indicates on requests to schools that the 20 day deadline is only
    during term time, and shows them as definitely overdue after 60 working days
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're getting really nerdy about all this, read the <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/detailed_specialist_guides/timeforcompliance.pdf">detailed ICO guidance</a>.
    Meanwhile, remember that the law says authorities must respond
    <strong>promptly</strong>. That's really what matters.</p>
  </dd>

  <!-- TODO -->
  <dt id="public_interest_test">How do you reflect time extensions for public interest tests?<a href="#public_interest_test">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The Freedom of Information Act lets authorities claim an indefinite time
    extension when applying a <strong>public interest test</strong>.  Information
    Commissioner guidance says that it should only be used in "exceptionally
    complex" cases
    (<a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/freedom_of_information/detailed_specialist_guides/foi_good_practice_guidance_4.pdf">FOI Good Practice Guidance No. 4</a>).
    <%= site_name %> doesn't specifically handle this case, which is why we use the
    phrase "should normally have responded by" when the 20 working day time is
    exceeded.
    </p>

    <p>The same guidance says that, even in exceptionally complex cases, no
    Freedom of Information request should take more than <strong>40 working days</strong>
    to answer.  <%= site_name %> displays requests which are overdue by that much
    with stronger wording to indicate they are definitely late.
    </p>

    <p>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act does not allow such a public
    interest extension. <%= site_name %> would like to see the law changed to either
    remove the extension from the UK Act, or to reintroduce an absolute time limit
    of 40 working days even with the extension (the House of Lords <a
    href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2000-10-17&amp;number=1&amp;house=lords">voted
    to remove</a> provision for such a time limit during the initial passage
    of the UK Act through Parliament).

  <dd>Instead of email, you can respond to a request directly from your web

    the bottom of the request's page. <a href="/help/contact">Contact us</a> if it

  <!-- TODO -->
  <dt id="names">Why do you publish the names of civil servants and the text of emails? <a href="#names">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>We consider what officers or servants do in the course of their employment
    to be public information. We will only remove content in exceptional
    circumstances, see our <a href="/help/privacy#takedown">take down policy</a>.
  </dd>

  <!-- TODO -->
  <dt id="mobiles">Do you publish email addresses or mobile phone numbers? <a href="#mobiles">#</a> </dt>
  <dd><p>To prevent spam, we automatically remove most emails and some mobile numbers from
    responses to requests.  Please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> if we've
    missed one.
    For technical reasons we don't always remove them from attachments, such as certain PDFs.</p>
    <p>If you need to know what an address was that we've removed, please <a

  If you think our making a document available on the internet infringes your
  copyright, you may <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> and ask us
  to take it down.  However, to save tax payers' money by preventing duplicate
  requests, and for good public relations, we'd advise you not to do that.
